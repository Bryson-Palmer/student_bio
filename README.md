## My student biography page

This is my first contribution to _git hub_ and my first marked down read me file. It is a __student biography__ page to help those in the community to get to know me a little bit. It is simply a static web page at the moment as I am at the very beginning of my web development education. The information is short and concise as it's a small non-scrolling page.

It does have working contact links to my:
*Gmail acount
*Git hub account
*A portfolio (that has yet to be built)
*A facebook link to *Palmer's in the Park*.

Included in the bio is a banner picture of *Palmer's in the Park* that was commissioned by my wife's friend. We payed for the picture so we own it. Also included is a headshot that my wife took with her Nikon D850 camera on my 41st birthday (Oct. 3rd, 2020).

## Palmer's in the Park

Is a new ambitious dream project for my wife and I. We love to visit all Disney parks and look forwawrd to visiting all of the National parks as well. We want to share our experiences, advice, and especially the magic and beauty with others. 
Here is the welcome text from the home page on our facebook:
*Welcome to the Wonderful World of the Palmers in the Parks. Adventure along with us as we discover and share the magic during all our Park Hopping shenanigans! Need help planning your next magical vacation? Send us a message!*
In the future I plan to build a web site for our domain name _palmersinthepark.com_. We will aslo be adding content like video reviews, tuturials, lists, and consulting. We need to add our first National park to the list as we just visited the west entrance of Glacier National park in Montana in August of 20' for our wedding anniversary. 

## Layout

Is fairly simple at this time. I made the entire page a container to help control the flow of content. There is a header block element containing the banner image and the h1 tag *Student Bio*. Next, I made a container called **bio-container**. It holds two sections **main-bio** and **contact-info**. **main-bio** is set to a width of 70% and **contact-info** is set to 30%. I used the float: left property to get the boxes in the places I wanted them to be.

## Style Sheet

I added an external style sheet to the file to stylize the elements and tags in the html. 

## Knowledge

It was a great first little project that can be expanded upon in the future. It's a great way to intorduce one's self to html elements/tags/syntax, css syntax/function, layout using box methods/floats, and to the Git process and protocol.
