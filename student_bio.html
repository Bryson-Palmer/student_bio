        <p>
          I am 41 years old and married with four children ages 1, 4, 7, and 10. I have my AA with an emphasis in Management Information Systems. I've been a stay-at-home dad for the last nine years. My wife and I have a Disney/National parks content project called Palmer's in the park. I've played guitar since I was 14 and have been in two bands (Meatpickle and Citizen hifi). I started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, kickboxing, Shooto, JKD/Kali, and Boxing at age 38. I once got a ride home from school from Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad or Caleb Nichols in Westworld). Now I'm embarking on a new journey to become a web developer. First stop is attending a coding bootcamp from the Universiy of Washington by Trilogy.

          I have little to no work history for the last nine years, but what I lack in work experience, I gained in life experience. It takes a strong commitment to raise four children, homeschool them, and take care of home and property. It was the perfect time for selfreflection. What I found was that I value doing the best I can at whatever I'm doing. It takes dedication and grit to commit to something with a long arch like family, music, martial arts, and now coding. I have learned so much about myself and now I'm ready to apply it to a new career. I will take my attention to detail, work ethos, and love for creating to a new height. I am learning more and more how to trust the process and even enjoy it. I aim to be better than I was the day before.
